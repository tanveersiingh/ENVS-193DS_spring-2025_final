      This data package contains sea surface temperature (SST) data in
      the Santa Barbara Channel area. Data was obtained from the NOAA
      National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) at 0.25°
      resolution for the time between 1982 and 2023. This Daily Optimum
      Interpolation Sea Surface Temperature (OISST) Analysis (Version
      2.1) derived its data from satellite (Advanced Very High
      Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR)) and in situ platforms (i.e., ships
      and buoys) and yielded 18 gird points within the Santa Barbara
      Channel.

               The Santa Barbara Coastal LTER (SBC LTER) is an interdisciplinary research and education program
established in April 2000 with the goal of developing a predictive understanding of how environmental
drivers interact with terrestrial and oceanic processes to alter material flows and influence the ecology of
coastal ecosystems. SBC LTER's principal study domain is the semi-arid coast and nearshore waters of
the Santa Barbara Channel in southern California, and its diverse and productive marine forests of giant
kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) serve as the focal study ecosystem. Analyses of our long-term data have
identified many of the environmental drivers and ecological processes underlying the production and
community dynamics of kelp forests. The research proposed to address this question is integrated in a conceptual framework
that focuses on the causes and ecological consequences of the dynamics of a relatively short-lived
foundation species in a setting of long-term climate change and human use.
            
         
         
            SBC LTER is supported by the National Science Foundation.
